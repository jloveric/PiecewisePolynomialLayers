# tf-nodal-polynomial-layers
Tensorflow layers using piecewise Chebyshev polynomials.  Earlier I wrote a c++ code that explored higher 
order weights in the synapse of of a standard neural network [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276923198_Discontinuous_Piecewise_Polynomial_Neural_Networks) .  This is an effort to reproduce that work in Tensorflow
